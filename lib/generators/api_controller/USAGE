Description:
    Generates a API controller with endpoints for basic crud operations.
    Pass the model name, either CamelCased or under_scored. The controller
    name is retrieved as a pluralized version of the model name.

    This generates a controller class in app/controllers/api.

    `rails generate api_controller Article`

    API Article controller with URLs like /api/articles/:id.
        Controller: app/controllers/api/articles_controller.rb
